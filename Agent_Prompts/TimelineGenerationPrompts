2. **Critical Gaps Timeline:**
   - For each of the top 5 critical skill gaps, provide a detailed timeline to address these gaps.
   - Include specific tasks, estimated time, and milestones for each critical gap.
   - If no data is available, set the critical gaps list to an empty list [] and the detailed timelines to an empty list [].

3. **Detailed Task Breakdown:**
   - For each identified skill gap, provide a detailed breakdown of the tasks and activities the user needs to complete.

5. **Weekly and Monthly Plans:**
   - Generate a weekly and monthly plan for the user to follow, breaking down the tasks and activities into manageable chunks.
   - Include specific tasks, estimated time, and due dates for each week and month.
   - If no data is available, set the weekly and monthly plans to an empty list [].

6. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Provide a detailed plan for resource allocation, including time management tips and resource usage strategies.
   - Explain how the user should allocate their time and resources to effectively address the identified skill gaps.
   - If no data is available, set the resource allocation plan to "N/A" and the time management tips to "N/A".

7. **Progress Checkpoints:**
   - Identify key progress checkpoints the user should use to track their progress.
   - Provide a list of checkpoints, including specific tasks and evaluation methods.
   - If no data is available, set the checkpoints to an empty list [] and the evaluation methods to an empty list [].

8. **Feedback and Adjustment:**
   - Provide a detailed plan for regular self-assessments and feedback mechanisms.
   - Explain how the user should seek feedback and make adjustments to their plan as they progress.
   - If no data is available, set the feedback and adjustment plan to "N/A".

9. **Potential Delays:**
   - Identify potential delays the user might encounter and provide strategies for handling these delays.
   - Explain how the user can stay on track and mitigate potential delays.
   - If no data is available, set the potential delays to an empty list [] and the mitigation strategies to an empty list [].

11. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Provide a detailed plan for ongoing learning and development activities.
    - Explain how the user can incorporate continuous improvement and learning into their timeline.
    - If no data is available, set the continuous improvement plan to "N/A".

12. **Career Trajectory:**
    - Provide a detailed projection of the user's career path, including potential job roles and career advancements.
    - Explain how the timeline aligns with the user's career trajectory and long-term goals.
    - If no data is available, set the career trajectory projection to "N/A" and the alignment explanation to "N/A".
